			</div>
			<p>Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in some countries, are large, 
				highly migratory predatory fish characterized by a long, flat, pointed bill 
				and is known to be one of the fastest fish in the sea. 
				They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category, though elusive. 
				Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. 
				These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, 
				and Indian Oceans, and can typically be found from near the surface to a depth of 550 m (1,800 ft), 
				and exceptionally up to depths of 2,234 m. They commonly reach 3 m (10 ft) in length, 
				and the maximum reported is 4.55 m (14 ft 11 in) in length and 650 kg (1,430 lb) in weight.</p>

		<p>Swordfish are one of the ocean's apex predators, and they have very few natural predators. 
			These fish prey on a wide variety of fish and cephalopods. 
			They have been known to feed throughout the entirety of the water column, 
			from the surface to depths as low as 3,000 feet.
			<br><br>
			These fish are uniquely adapted to tolerate a broad range of settings, including cold water, 
			warm water, and depths ranging from 3,000 feet to the surface. 
			While swordfish are coldblooded creatures, they have a unique heat regulation system that warms 
			their brains and eyes, allowing them to hunt in colder waters effectively as they use their long, flattened bill 
			that looks like a sword, as their name implies.

				<br>
				Swordfish are not schooling fish. They swim alone or in very loose aggregations, 
				separated by as much as 10 m (35 ft) from a neighboring swordfish. 
				They are frequently found basking at the surface, airing their first dorsal fin. 
				Boaters report this to be a beautiful sight, as is the powerful jumping for which the species is known. 
				This jumping, also called breaching, may be an effort to dislodge pests, such as remoras or lampreys.
